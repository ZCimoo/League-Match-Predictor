# League of Legends Match Predictor
League of Legends match predictor using machine learning models. Expected to create two seperate models, one to make a prediction before the game begins, and another to actively predict the game as its being played. The second model will poll the game around every minute to see if there are any changes. To train these models I will need to collect game data from Riot Games API.

## Motivation
There are a handful of reason I picked this project, the main one being that I am currently addicted to League of Legends. The others being this is a great chance for me to learn and practice Python and Data Science. I also find it really interesting and this is something that I am actually really excited to create compared to other projects I have worked on.
